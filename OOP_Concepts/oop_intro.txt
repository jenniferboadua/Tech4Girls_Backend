Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that resolves around the concepts of objects and classes.

Encapsulation involves the idea of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a singleunit called a class.

Abstraction invoves the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding theimplementation details,

Inheritance involves the mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and behaviour of another class.

Polymorphism invoves the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used.


Benefits of OOP in software development 
..Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance , hence teams do not have to write same codes multiple times.
..Maintenance: Modifying or extending existing codes is easier with OOp.
..Flexibility: Polymorphism allows a single function to adapt the class it is placed in.


Real-world Examples
..Cars are broke down in subclasses like "sports car" and "v8 sports car" to add more features without identifying all of them at the same time.
..Water can exist in three state as liquid, solid and gas based on temperature.
..Building web applications with user accounts, shopping carts and payment processing.
